## General info :
Since budgeting allows you to create a spending plan for your money, it ensures that you will always have enough money for the things you need and the things that are important to you. Following a budget or spending plan will also keep you out of debt or help you work your way out of debt if you are currently in debt. It is even more important to be able to keep up with budgeting when you're on the go and you might not have data/internet connection and you still want the most up to date information. This application aims to solve that problem.
